              This is open to any youth who is interested in becoming

              No prior knowledge or experience is needed. If you can read this

            <h2>Why is it free?</h2>
            <p>
              Techie Youth is a donation-funded charity that has been providing
              totally-free tech-education to hundreds of NYC foster kids and
              at-risk youth since 2015; our classroom-based program was
              disrupted by the pandemic preventing large-gatherings, so we are
              making lemonade from the lemon-situation by transitioning our
              program into a free online platform available to all youth
              worldwide.
            </p>

            <h2>What is the online-course like?</h2>
            <p>
              Expect lots of fun and inspiration! Much of the curriculum is
              video-based with interactive facets throughout; human-help is
              always available if needed. Some of the content is gamified, so
              <strong
                >if you like playing video games then you will love those
                topics.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              The program uses an accelerated-learning format covering content
              <strong>equivalent to 10 college credits</strong>, and is open to
              youth of all grades, from age 13 and up!
            </p>
            <p>
              Each student learns at their own pace and schedule, taking as much
              or as little time as needed, but most will complete the program in
              about 6-weeks, spending 3-5 hours per day.
